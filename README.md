# Adwaita-OSX
Adwaita with OSX window controls with full support for dark Adwaita theme

For people who just want the default experience enhanced just a bit

Based on USBA's Adwaita-OSX repository that sadly, hasn't been updated in over 8 months, and since it is under GPL, I figured I'd take over.
The difference with my repo is that I also made dark version and install scripts.

## Instalation
You will find two different install scripts in the repo. The first doesn't have to be run as superuser and will install the themes to your $HOME/.themes. The other has to be run as superuser and will install the themes to /usr/share/themes. Choose whichever you like better.
